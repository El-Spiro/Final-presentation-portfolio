# Final-presentation-portfolio

# Intoduction:
Hello everyone, My name is Jason, i am presenting this portfolio for the final project. Within this presentation, I've highlighted some of the completed assignments and exercises that I've worked on throughout this course. Additionally, I've added a resume that explains not only how the scripts function and how does how serve us, all the following scripts are found in my Github page 



# I)Cluster Linux diagnostic command

# script explanation:
this script works by using multiple networking diagnostic commands function and store them each into a given variable.
We activate each command by running echo request to the variable we obtain the current results in the picture bellow. 
This script serves as a multiple command launcher aiding the user to diagnose the machine connectivity to the internet network

# II)Linux firewall security rules
# script explanation:
we have constructed a script that offers detailed instructions on how we want our machine firewall to function.

1-In this script, we secure our SSH traffic but allow SHH connection from a specific computer MAC address.

3-Because HTTP protocol is insecure, we block HTTP incoming and outgoing traffic protecting our machine communication to the web

4-Blocking The Telnet traffic protocol is highly recommended because Telnet lacks encryption and authentication mechanisms, leaving it vulnerable due to its older design. 

5-To protect our machine from D- DOS attack we decided to block incoming  ICMP ping echo and  trace route request 

### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
